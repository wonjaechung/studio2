# **App Name**: DuneChain Explorer

## Core Features:

- Data Parsing: Parse raw blockchain data, making it searchable and filterable for onchain analysis.
- Data Structuring: Organize blockchain data into relational data tables for the most popular EVM chains (such as Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum) using a V2 SQL engine.
- AI Data Summarization: Generate natural language summaries of blockchain datasets (blocks, transactions, logs) to make blockchain content understandable by non-experts; use a tool to determine what elements need explanation in each case.
- Smart Contract Decoding: Implement a spellbook to transform decoded calls and events in a GitHub repository so it can generate parsed tables of smart contracts.
- Community Sourced data.: Provide community tables with sourced data to help user perform Onchain analytics.

## Style Guidelines:

- Dark color scheme to evoke a sense of exploration and data-focus.
- Primary color: Deep blue (#2E3192) for a calm and trustworthy feel.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#121212), near black.
- Accent color: Electric purple (#BE0AFF) to add an exciting and hightech touch. Accent purple to also subtly show flow of chain.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif for computerized, scientific headlines; classifications include code snippets.
- Body font: 'Inter' sans-serif with a modern, objective look.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' monospace for computer code, if and when it appears.
- Use clear, simple icons representing different chains and data types.
- Divide the interface into clear, modular sections for data browsing, AI summarization, and community contributions.
- Use subtle animations, not distracting ones. Consider progress bars for blockchain data processing and loading, as well as smooth transitions for AI summary updates.
